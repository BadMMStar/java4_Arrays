Comment:
  1. We find the max value and its index is assigned to a variable, 
     then using the variable tmp we swap the max and min elements.
     
  2. Bubble sorting method ascending
  
  3. We declare a variable that assigns the sum of all the elements of the array 
     and divide by the number of elements and get the average value of all the elements in the array
     
  4. Check array elements the sum of even and odd numbers. 
     The division by %2 will give us 0 with comparison == 0 gives an even number
     
  5. Simple output of the matrix, so that the table is obtained, 
     the output of the element for each new line "\ n" in the first loop is needed.
     
  6. In task 1 we find both max and min elements, we can simply add the output line max element.
     But I still created the maxX() method and commented out, in any case, the result is correct.
     
  7. Strings initialized in one pool we could use == that would output the result "true". 
     In any case, the method is used in the branch equals() which compares each value in the string.
     And in System.out.print() I added lines to avoid initializing another variable.
